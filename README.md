In this game you need to match pairs of cards with the same symbole

## How to Play:
Playing is very simple - you turn over one tile and then try to find a matching tile. There are 16 cards and 8 pairs total. The game ends once all pairs are matched.

The score panel shows the star raiting, how many moves have been made, and time.

When game ends, you will get a message that displays the star raiting, how many moves have been made, and how long it takes to finish the game.
